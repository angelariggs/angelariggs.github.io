  <h2 class='project-sec-header'>About OSU - NEP</h2>
  <p>The internal content team for OSU's Nutrition Education Program website desired a simpler content management system, with more intuitive site architecture and admin interface. To help the OSU - NEP team accomplish their goals, we rebuilt the NEP site on Drupal 7, designed and implemented a new site layout, and created flexible content types for the team's resources.</p>


  <h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>My intial contributions to PeaceHealth were QA'ing JIRA tickets for development work, and styling the admin user interface with CSS/Sass. As the project grew, there were more opportunities for me to contribute, and I began doing Drupal development work for PeaceHealth.</p>

  <p>Some of my main contributions for this project included building a module for the top navigation; creating detailed documentation for the PeaceHealth admin team's training; testing and configuring the Workbench module according to the team's needs; styling the footer content and Medical Center banner flyouts, as well as the administration interface theme.</p>
