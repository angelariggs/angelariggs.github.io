<div id="land">
	<p> I acknowledge the land on which I sit and occupy in Portland, Oregon. The Portland Metro area rests on traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Wasco, Cowlitz, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Bands of Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, and many other tribes who made their homes along the Columbia River. I thank the people of these tribes and their descendants for being the original caretakers and protectors of this land.</p>
