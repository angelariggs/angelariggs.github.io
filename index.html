<div id="land">
	<p> I acknowledge the land on which we sit and which we occupy. The Portland Metro area rests on traditional village sites of the Multnomah, Wasco, Cowlitz, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Bands of Chinook, Tualatin, Kalapuya, Molalla, and many other tribes who made their homes along the Columbia River. We take this opportunity to thank the original caretakers of this land.</p>
