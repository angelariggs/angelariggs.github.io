	  <div class="entry">
	    <p>I stumbled onto an interesting Twitter conversation the other day, and I&#39;ve been looking forward to continuing my thoughts in a broader form here on my blog.</p>

<p>The conversation in question revolved around the use of titles for developers, and what those titles actually denote or communicate about the person who holds a specific title. The meaning behind dev titles was especially unclear when it comes to the role of a &quot;junior&quot; developer.</p>

<p>When I see a job posting with the word &quot;junior&quot; in them, I don&#39;t always know what that says about the company&#39;s expectations - but I know what it means to me, and I hope that the company&#39;s meaning comes close.</p>

<p>To me, &quot;junior&quot; indicates a level of responsibility, rather than a level of skill or experience. As a junior developer, I want to have code reviews and possibly pair programming throughout the week, to help strengthen my coding knowledge and best practices. And &quot;best practices&quot; refers not only to coding, but also to the workflows and processes that differ from one company to another.</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://mathys-potestio.com/want-to-be-a-developer-where-to-start-and-what-to-expect/">code school graduate</a> and current dev intern, I know that there are many things I don&#39;t yet know. But when considering my classification as an employee, should my experience in development be the only experience considered? In addition to my 9 months of dev work, I have years of client-facing experience with high communication and problem-solving skills, and I was a teacher for three years. Don&#39;t these skills and experiences add value to my role as a developer? Being able to communicate clearly with clients, or share knowledge with colleagues would seem to be valuable assets.</p>

<p>And with the ever-changing nature of technology and development work, tying the definition of <em>junior</em> specifically to dev experience can get kind of shaky. For instance, let&#39;s say that a JavaScript developer fresh out of bootcamp gets hired at a .NET agency, looking to branch out into other technologies. In terms of overall years of dev experience, that bootcamp graduate would be considered a junior. But when that .NET company starts working on their first JavaScript project, that same bootcamp graduate is the resident expert.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&#39;ve talked about what the junior title means to me, and why it can be a tenuous thing to define - but what does it mean to tech companies? It&#39;s one thing to read about tech stacks in a job posting - but how does the title of &quot;junior&quot; set a company&#39;s expectations of work, and how do they communicate those expectations?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subject of job titles has been a recent topic of conversation here at <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/">Metal Toad</a>, especially in relation to career paths. As a developer (junior, staff, or senior), what really are the expectations for skillsets? And if these expectations aren&#39;t set transparently and clearly, how does a junior dev set goals to complete for becoming a staff developer?</p>

<p>We asked, and our <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/people/matthewgarthmcluckie">Director of Development</a> answered! Matthew and our dev team leads worked together to create a career matrix for junior, staff, and senior developers. The matrix includes expectations for all areas of life as a Toad: teamwork habits, development, methodologies, and vision &amp; passion. And while I might like to see some of the items expanded on with more specific criteria for success, most of the descriptions are written with enough detail that I can set and meet goals for advancement.</p>

<p><em>The conversation on Twitter included <a href="https://twitter.com/realntl">Nathan Ladd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kwuchu">Iheanyi Ekechukwu</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/TwoBlackNerds">Two Black Nerds</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wycats">Yehuda Katz</a> of <a href="http://www.tilde.io/">Tilde</a>.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Devs coming out of a code school are pre-juniors</li>
<li>Mostly have learned <em>how to think</em> like a dev</li>
<li>Need more mentoring / pairing for dev work</li>
<li>Transition from intern to jr

<ul>
<li>What are the expectations of skills for a junior dev?</li>
<li>What do employers mean when they say &#39;junior&#39;?</li>
<li>What do jr devs think it means?</li>
<li>Look for on job postings, indicates to me that employer recognizes the dev in this position will need more mentoring</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Career matrix / path in general

<ul>
<li>Majority of devs look to increase skills / position</li>
<li>How do they know when they&#39;ve hit co. expectation / goals?</li>
<li>How do devs set goals if they don&#39;t know the expectations?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With ever-changing technologies, a &quot;junior&quot; may be more expert in something than a senior dev</li>
</ul>

<p>As a <a href="http://mathys-potestio.com/want-to-be-a-developer-where-to-start-and-what-to-expect/">code school graduate</a> and current dev intern,</p>
