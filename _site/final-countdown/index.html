    <p>As I write this, I&#39;m entering into the second week of capstone projects at Portland Code School. The lectures are done, although the learning continues, as we use our knowledge of full-stack JavaScript to build our own web apps!</p>

<p>My group consists of <a href="nathanbrennerjavascript.wordpress.com">Nate</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpoff">Curt</a>, and myself. We went though the <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com/webdevelopmentprimer/">Foundations Course</a> together, and our learning and collaboration styles work well together. I&#39;m really happy that we all agreed to work on the web app that I proposed - it&#39;s been cool to see it taking shape! We&#39;re building a site called <a href="https://github.com/nathan-j-brenner/snapOR">snapOR</a>. As a hiker and photographer, I spend a lot of time going between different websites to look up cool hikes, and researching the kind of photos that people have taken there. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have all of that information - hikes and photos - in a single website? Our web app is the answer to that!</p>

<p>We&#39;re using Jade, Foundation, and Backbone.js for front-end; and Orchestrate.io for the back-end. We have some Express server happening, but a lot of it&#39;s going to be in Backbone, since we&#39;re creating a single-page app at the suggestion of our project advisors, <a href="https://github.com/smashdevcode">James</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kenhowardpdx">Ken</a> from <a href="http://www.csgpro.com/">CSGPro</a>. We&#39;re using APIs from Google Maps, Oregon State Parks, and Flickr, and we&#39;ll add in Weather Underground if we get to Version 2! This project has really helped me bring together my code knowledge from the two months of class, and I&#39;m really proud to be contributing to the front-end and back-end work.</p>

<p>This week, I&#39;m digging into Backbone. My grasp of it is still shaky, and I&#39;ve spent part of my time trying to find coherent tutorials on using Backbone for a single-page app. It&#39;s slowly coming together, and I have a feeling that most of my time this week will be devoted to understanding and building with Backbone. </p>

<p>On that note, it&#39;s time to dive back into the wild world of Backbone - wish me luck! (And if you have any resources that helped you learn Backbone, please send it my way! You can tweet me at <a href="">@angelariggs_</a>)</p>
