<p>I believe that empathy and curiosity are driving forces of quality. I appreciate the hikers’ approach of “leave it better than you found it” and strive to do the same, whether it’s people, processes, or the organization as a whole. My experience in quality has ranged from feature testing with engineering teams to leading company-wide policy changes. I enjoy my work the most when it allows me to learn and collaborate, and I love finding opportunities for process improvements. Company culture is also important to me, and I strive to be an advocate and active participant in maintaining a positive, safe, and inclusive environment.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy loom weaving, traveling, and finding new sci-fi books to read. I have a great enthusiasm for karaoke, and serious debates about what can truly be categorized as a sandwich.</p>
