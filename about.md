Hello! I'm a former teacher, current student, and future developer. My experience is with full-stack JavaScript, using jQuery and Angular.js for front-end work, and Node.js and PostGreSQL for back-end.
When I'm away from my computer, I enjoy exploring and [photographing](https://angelariggs.exposure.co/) the Pacific Northwest, finding new sci-fi authors to read, and the occasional Netflix [binge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)).
