I believe that compassion and curiosity are the driving forces of quality and leadership. The hiker’s mindset “leave it better than you found it” inspires my approach at work - whether it’s people, processes, or the organization as a whole. I enjoy my job the most when I get to take on challenges that allow me to learn and grow, and when I’m supporting people and teams to do their best work.

You can check out my resume and career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelariggs), and find me tweeting about various topics at [@AngelaRiggs_](https://twitter.com/AngelaRiggs_).
