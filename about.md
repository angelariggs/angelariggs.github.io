<p>I support quality. Whether it’s the product, my engineering teams, or the organization as a whole, understanding and creating quality is my passion. As a QA engineer, I’m often presented with challenges from a variety of perspectives, and I enjoy helping people figure out the best solutions. My role is a unique blend of supportive and leadership positions, and I approach my work with empathy, curiosity, and a positive energy. Each day, I focus on making sure our users, my team, and our company have what they need in order to succeed.</p>

<p>My role at Vacasa involves testing, quality assurance, and release management for the Guest Experience team, which owns Trip Manager and Guest Transactional Emails. My responsibilities include:
<ul>
	<li>Introducing automation through a suite of regression tests as we launch new features and transition from PHP to React</li>
	<li>mproving team processes to create better workflows and shared understandings of the work being done</li>
	<li>Leading the creation of feature documentation for our in-house Customer Experience team</li>
	<li>Acceptance testing new features to help ensure we’re building the right things the right way</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love discovering new books, enthusiastic karaoke nights, and serious debates on what exactly can be defined as a sandwich.</p>
