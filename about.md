<p>Hello! I'm a web developer in Portland, OR. As a developer, I love finding opportunities for collaboration and creative problem-solving. I take on coding with determination and humor, always seeking to learn new things and share knowledge with others. My experience as a teacher has taught me to be reflective about my skills and goals, and honed my ability to communicate clearly and effectively. I bring a positive energy to the workplace, and truly enjoy the challenges and rewards of coding.</p>

<p>I learned the foundations of full-stack JavaScript through a three-month coding bootcamp, using a combination of HTML/Jade, CSS/Sass, Foundation, and Backbone for front-end, with Node, Express, and AJAX on the back-end.</p>

<p>When I'm not playing with the interwebs, I enjoy exploring and <a class='res-link' href="https://angelariggs.exposure.co/" target="_blank">photographing</a> the Pacific Northwest, finding new sci-fi authors to read, and the occasional Netflix <a class='res-link' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)" target="_blank">binge</a>.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic about everything, I laugh really loudly, and love throwing dinner parties. My hand-drawn curly braces are top-notch, and I have a Bacon Number of 3.</p>
