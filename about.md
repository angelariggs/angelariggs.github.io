ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a Quality Advocate in Portland, OR. 

I believe that Quality = Compassion + Curiosity. The hiker's mantra "leave it better than you found it" inspires my approach at work, whether itâ€™s people, processes, or the organization as a whole. I love my job the most when I get to take on challenges that allow me to learn and grow, and when Iâ€™m supporting people and teams to do their best work. 

You can check out my resume and career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelariggs), and find me tweeting about various topics at [@AngelaRiggs_](https://twitter.com/AngelaRiggs_).
