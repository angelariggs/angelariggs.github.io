<p>Hello! I'm a former teacher, recent code school student, and current web developer in Portland, OR. I learned the foundations of full-stack JavaScript through a three-month coding bootcamp, using a combination of HTML/CSS, Sass, Foundation, and Backbone for front-end, with Node, Express, and AJAX on the back-end.</p> 

<p>As a developer intern at <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/">Metal Toad</a>, I've been learning Drupal basics, as well as QA processes for both web-based and mobile client projects.</p> 

<p>When I'm not creating and controlling the interwebs, I enjoy exploring and <a class='res-link' href="https://angelariggs.exposure.co/" target="_blank">photographing</a> the Pacific Northwest, finding new sci-fi authors to read, and the occasional Netflix <a class='res-link' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)" target="_blank">binge</a>.</p>

<p>When I am building with code, I do so with determination, a commitment to solving problems, and humor. I accept that struggling with code means I'm learning new things, and I look forward to the struggles and the successes every day! Nobody will ever know all of the things, but a collaborative workplace means we can all know quite a lot of the things together.</p> 

<p>I thrive in an environment where humor and collaboration are encouraged, and there are opportunities to build new skills.</p>  

<p>I'm optimistic and enthusiastic, I laugh loudly, and I will invite you to taco parties. My hand-drawn curly braces are top-notch, and I have a Bacon Number of 4.</p>
