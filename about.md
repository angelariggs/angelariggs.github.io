Hello! I'm a former teacher, recent student, and current JavaScript developer. My experience is with full-stack JavaScript, using a combination of HTML/CSS, Jade, Sass, Foundation, and Backbone for front-end; Node, Express, JavaScript, and AJAX on the back-end; and Orchestrate, PostGreSQL, and MongoDB for databases.   

When I'm not creating and controlling the interwebs with JavaScript, I enjoy exploring and <a href="https://angelariggs.exposure.co/" target="_blank">photographing</a> the Pacific Northwest, finding new sci-fi authors to read, and the occasional Netflix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)" target="_blank">binge</a>.

When I am building with JavaScript, I do so with determination, a commitment to solving problems, and humor. I accept that struggling with code means I'm learning new things, and I look forward to the struggles and the successes every day! Nobody will ever know all of the things, but a collaborative workplace means we can all know quite a lot of the things together.  


# Hire me!

Although my foundation is in full-stack JavaScript, I'd love to start my career with front-end/UX work, and find an agency that values mentorship and collaboration. I would thrive in an environment where humor is encouraged, and there are opportunities to build new skills.  

I'm optimistic and enthusiastic, I laugh loudly, and I will invite you to taco parties.  

Also, I have a Bacon Number of 4.
