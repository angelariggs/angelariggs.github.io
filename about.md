<p>Whether itâ€™s the product, engineering teams, or the organization as a whole, understanding and creating quality is my passion. I approach my work with empathy and curiosity, and believe those traits are driving forces of quality. As a QA engineer, my role is a unique blend of supportive and leadership responsibilties, and my experience has ranged from feature testing for engineering teams to leading department-wide process changes. I focus on making sure our users, our teams, and our company have what they need in order to succeed.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy exploring all of the books in Powell's or the beautiful nature of the Pacific Northwest. I have an enthusiasm for karaoke, and serious debates about what can truly be categorized as a sandwich.</p>
