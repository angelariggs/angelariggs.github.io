<p>Hello! I'm a programmer in Portland, OR. As a developer and QA engineer, I work with determination and a positive energy. I strive to deliver a quality product that meets our clients' needs, and that our team can truly be proud of. My goal is to always continue learning and exploring new skills, and I love being a part of the knowledge-sharing and collaboration that helps make the tech community a better place. </p>

<p>When I'm not playing with the interwebs, I enjoy exploring and <a class='res-link' href="https://angelariggs.exposure.co/" target="_blank">photographing</a> the Pacific Northwest, finding new sci-fi authors to read, and the occasional Netflix <a class='res-link' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)" target="_blank">binge</a>.</p>

<p>I'm optimistic about everything, I laugh really loudly, and love throwing dinner parties. My hand-drawn curly braces are top-notch, and I have a Bacon Number of 3.</p>
