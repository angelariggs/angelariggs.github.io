I believe that compassion and curiosity are the driving forces of leadership. The hiker’s mindset “leave it better than you found it” inspires my approach at work - whether it’s people, processes, or the organization as a whole. I enjoy my job the most when I get to take on challenges that allow me to learn and grow, and when I’m supporting people and teams to do their best work.

If you'd like to know more about some of the approaches I take as a manager, please read through my [Manager README]({% post_url 2022-03-22-manager-readme %})! If you're interested in some of the resources I find valuable and continue to learn from, please check out my [Resources page]({% link resources.md %}), and you can check out my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelariggs).
