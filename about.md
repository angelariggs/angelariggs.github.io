<div class='add-pad'>

<p>As a QA engineer, my work has ranged from feature testing to leading department-wide process changes. I believe that empathy and curiosity are driving forces of quality, and use both to advocate for users and engineering teams.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the aisles of Powellâ€™s and the forests of the PNW. I have an enthusiasm for karaoke, and serious debates about what can truly be categorized as a sandwich.</p>
