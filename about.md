<p>As a QA Engineer, I approach my work with determination and a positive energy, holding myself and my teams to a high standard. I appreciate that my field calls on my curiosity and attention to detail. I've enjoyed creating my role at the intersections of tester, dev ops, and scrum master, and understanding how I can support engineering teams and departments through iterative and useful processes.</p>

<p>I love people problems as much as technical ones, and work hard to be a leader who offers empathy, support, and thoughtful problem-solving to my team and my company.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I love discovering new books, enthusiastic karaoke nights, and serious debates on what exactly can be defined as a sandwich.</p>
