If you look up the word _technical_, you'll see it defined as “relating to a particular subject, art, or craft, or its techniques.” Nothing about that description indicates that understanding programming is a technical skill and understanding people is not. Yet somehow, the idea of technical skills has come to mean just that, with the inverse being _soft skills_. This meaning of so-called _technical skills_ and _soft skills_ sets up an unbalanced system where people with technical skills are assumed to be valued in a way that non-technical people aren't, and does a real disservice to the importance of soft skills.


I've been mulling over writing this blog post for awhile now. That opening paragraph has been in my drafts since November 2018, waiting patiently while I worried aobut whether this topic was "technical" enough. Since then, I've created and given my favorite talk [Why is There a Marble in Your Nose?](https://speakerdeck.com/angelariggs/stpcon-why-is-there-a-marble-in-your-nose), and I'm no longer worried about it. I know that my soft skills have helped shape my career in tech. My experience as an early childhood teacher has absolutely influenced who I am as a tester, and I use those combined learnings as I'm continuing into my third career as a people manager.

As I dust off this draft and get to writing, I'm thinking back to my testing days.
