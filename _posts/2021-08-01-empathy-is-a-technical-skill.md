If you look up the word _technical_, you'll see it defined as “relating to a particular subject, art, or craft, or its techniques.” Nothing about that description indicates that understanding programming is a technical skill and understanding people is not. Yet somehow, the idea of technical skills has come to mean just that, with the inverse being _soft skills_. This meaning of so-called _technical skills_ and _soft skills_ sets up an unbalanced system where people with technical skills are assumed to be valued in a way that non-technical people aren't, and does a real disservice to the importance of soft skills.


As a former teacher, I know that my soft skills have been incredibly impactful throughout my career in tech.
