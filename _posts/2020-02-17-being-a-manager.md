Congratulations, you're a manager ðŸŽ‰ First step off the IC path, first rung of the leadership ladder - exciting career changes! 

So - now what? How is your role changing? What do you _do_ when you're a manager? How is it different from your IC responsibilities? What shifts in work and, more importantly, shifts in strategy and perspective will you need to make? A career ladder should offer some insights here, but many companies don't have one. Drawing on the advice of tech managers who have learned this through experience, let's take a look at some of those shifts:

- Be ready to change what "productive" looks like in your mind. Your to-do list is more about others and making sure they are able to complete tasks than about your contributions to the deliverable.
- Develop your people not your position, if you do your position will develop itself with management and just importantly with your team. Good luck!
- Speak mostly in terms of objectives and goals, work for collaboration within the team and with peers and our customers.
- I would have focused very intently on understanding what my company values from the role. It looks very different in different places.
- While your team may be reporting to you, you are actually working to enable them.
- That management without leadership will get you nowhere. And that leadership, just as management, is something you study and practice and improve over time, itâ€™s not charisma or a hidden talent you either have or donâ€™t.
- For me: delegate, be patient, and remember the speed bumps you hit arenâ€™t the end of the world.  My mom told me when I first become a tech manager that a managerâ€™s job is to give their team the tools and space to succeed and it turned out to be the best advice.
- Your success will be measured through your teams success. 
- Oh, and never ever abandon the consequences of your own leadership. I reiterate - you're the leader. It's on you. If it's broke, own it. It's the cost of leadership. Cry in the bathroom if you have to, and then go back like you were always in control the whole time and *fix it*.
- Learn how to redefine success for yourself. Productivity is no longer easy to quantify 
- Every bit of IC work you do is a missed opportunity for someone else


**Understand what your company values from the role.** You have to know what you're aiming for! If you've got a career ladder, you probably have an advantage here, because the org already has some definition of success. (I say _probably_ because not all ladders are created equal.) But let's assume you don't have a career ladder - how do you find out this information? Ideally, it's come up in pre-promotion conversations with your manager. If you feel comfortable talking to your manager's manager, you should also get their perspective on it. People will likely have different expectations and assumptions around what is considered valuable in your new role. Know who the key players are in your career trajectory, and make sure you're aligned with their assumptions.
