Congratulations, you're a manager ðŸŽ‰ First step off the IC path, first rung of the leadership ladder - exciting career changes! 

So - now what? How is your role changing, exactly? What do you... _do_ when you're a manager? How is it different from your IC responsibilities? What shifts in work and, more importantly, perspective will you need to make? If your company has a career ladder, you might get some insight, but not all companies have them.

**Understand what your company values from the role.** 

**Learn how to redefine success for yourself.** 

**Be ready to change what "productive" looks like in your mind.** 

**Management without leadership will get you nowhere. And that leadership, just as management, is something you study and practice and improve over time.**

**A managerâ€™s job is to give their team the tools and space to succeed.**

**Never ever abandon the consequences of your own leadership.**
