üåà Welcome to Reading Roundup 5! 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never Ignore a Recruiter](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556) (Alex Chesser)**

Initial cold contacts are often less than ideal, but Alex points out the potential benefits of moving past your eye-roll reaction and actually \*gasp\* replying to them! He has a great template for getting relevant information, and I love that he breaks it down to explain the different sections and the outcomes he's looking for. 
 

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Not everyone can become a great leader‚Ä¶](https://matt-schellhas.medium.com/not-everyone-can-become-a-great-leader-196916d82873) (Matt Schellhas)**

"Not everyone can become a great leader, but a great leader can come from anywhere." I really like Matt's perspective here - I feel like we hear a lot about "inspiration leadership", but tend to have a pretty narrow definition of what that looks like.

It's interesting to think about how we can broaden our understanding leadership and how we define inspiration. _Core of a community_ leadership - inspiring people to welcome others in and make sure folks feel like they belong. Leadership through _Creating beautiful visions_ - inspiring people that those things are possible, or to create their own lofty visions. Leadership _through teaching and knowledge_ - inspiring people to seek out knowledge and context, to see how they benefit from it and to do the same for others.


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Feeling Rough and Not Getting Anything Done? Take a Minimum Viable Day](https://ashleyjanssen.com/feeling-rough-and-not-getting-anything-done-take-a-minimum-viable-day/) (Ashley Janssen)**

1000% yes and agree with all of this! Ashley's article is super helpful, especially as we're hitting the 712th day of March 2020 üò∞ Times are hard, y'all. Be kind with yourself. This is a great read, and I foresee myself referring back to it often.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **[How to structure the interviews process to limit bias in hiring](https://tararobertson.ca/2022/how-to-structure-the-interviews-process-to-limit-bias-in-hiring/) (Tara Robertson)**

This is the fourth post in Tara's series about inclusive hiring! She offers really great, actionable ways to approach your hiring process and find ways to make it more inclusive. Highly recommend reading the whole series!


### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **[Reacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reacher_(TV_series))**

Okay, a little bit of a departure here üòÑ But it's based on a book series that I love, so I'm including it here! I passed on the Tom Cruise movies becuase I just couldn't get past the physical differences in his portrayal of Reacher - Reacher's physicality is such a big part of his character! But some folks who like the books said that they enjoyed the new tv series, so I took a chance and checked it out. And ya know, I really liked it! There are a few things I have a minor quibble with, but overall I enjoyed it and I'm hoping for a second season ü§ûüèº
