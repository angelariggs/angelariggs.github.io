Someone asked me today who my mentors have been, and it was an unexpected opportunity to reflect on who's helped shape my career. Thinking back, I knew immediately that it wasn't mentorship in a specific technology or career path that made a difference, but more generally in a way of working.

At my first job in tech, I was fortunate to be part of a team with some really great people (including one who continues to hold the title of Best Human. We all agreed, nobody will change our minds). They were sharp technologists, but that wasn't what left an impression.

They were eager collaborators - always ready to share knowledge or learn from someone else. They made it okay to ask questions. They supported people as individuals, and in turn we all supported our teammates and team to succeed. They listened to me, even as a brand-new QA engineer. I had the freedom to try new things, and they trusted me to take ownership over quality and testing initiatives. And they chose, always, to build the right things the right way, even if it meant more work.

My experience with that team helped inform the way I like to work today. I love finding the pain points and figuring out how to iterate and improve. I enjoy doing the work that supports people and teams to do their best work. I've taken on projects beyond my role and been successful, simply because nobody ever told me I shouldn't or couldn't. I believe in supporting people as people first, and that doing so is what leads to success for teams and companies.

So to my first team, thank you - for your support when I was a wee newbie, for your mentorship, and for showing me early what's important about the work we do. TMNT always ❤️
