title:  "Junior Developer - What Does it Mean?"

I stumbled onto an interesting Twitter conversation the other day, and I've been looking forward to continuing my thoughts in a broader form here on my blog.

The conversation in question revolved around the use of titles for developers, and what those titles actually denote or communicate about the person who holds a specific title. The meaning behind dev titles was especially unclear when it comes to the role of a "junior" developer.

When I see a job posting with the word "junior" in them, I don't always know what that says about the company's expectations - but I know what it means to me, and I hope that the company's meaning comes close.

To me, "junior" indicates a level of responsibility, rather than a level of skill or experience. As a junior developer, I want to have code reviews and possibly pair programming throughout the week, to help strengthen my coding knowledge and best practices. And "best practices" refers not only to coding, but also to the workflows and processes that differ from one company to another.

As a [code school graduate](http://mathys-potestio.com/want-to-be-a-developer-where-to-start-and-what-to-expect/) and current dev intern, I know that there are many things I don't yet know. But when considering my classification as an employee, should my experience in development be the only experience considered? In addition to my 9 months of dev work, I have years of client-facing experience with high communication and problem-solving skills, and I was a teacher for three years. Don't these skills and experiences add value to my role as a developer? Being able to communicate clearly with clients, or share knowledge with colleagues would seem to be valuable assets.

And with the ever-changing nature of technology and development work, tying the definition of _junior_ specifically to dev experience can get kind of shaky. For instance, let's say that a JavaScript developer fresh out of bootcamp gets hired at a .NET agency, looking to branch out into other technologies. In terms of overall years of dev experience, that bootcamp graduate would be considered a junior. But when that .NET company starts working on their first JavaScript project, that same bootcamp graduate is the resident expert.

> _I've talked about what the junior title means to me, and why it can be a tenuous thing to define - but what does it mean to tech companies? It's one thing to read about tech stacks in a job posting - but how does the title of "junior" set a company's expectations of work, and how do they communicate those expectations?_

The subject of job titles has been a recent topic of conversation here at [Metal Toad](http://www.metaltoad.com/), especially in relation to career paths. As a developer (junior, staff, or senior), what really are the expectations for skillsets? And if these expectations aren't set transparently and clearly, how does a junior dev set goals to complete for becoming a staff developer?

* Devs coming out of a code school are pre-juniors
* Mostly have learned *how to think* like a dev
* Need more mentoring / pairing for dev work
* Transition from intern to jr
  * What are the expectations of skills for a junior dev?
  * What do employers mean when they say 'junior'?
  * What do jr devs think it means?
    * Look for on job postings, indicates to me that employer recognizes the dev in this position will need more mentoring
* Career matrix / path in general
  * Majority of devs look to increase skills / position
  * How do they know when they've hit co. expectation / goals?
  * How do devs set goals if they don't know the expectations?
* With ever-changing technologies, a "junior" may be more expert in something than a senior dev
