* [Introducing change: Risk based regression](https://fishoutthebox.medium.com/introducing-change-risk-based-regression-58969eb7bce9) from Melissa Fisher: Melissa uses the concept of risk-based regression testing as a great vehicle for talking about change management! It's one thing to be confident that the change you're suggesting is necessary, but it's another effort entirely to actually get that buy-in ðŸ˜„ I need to look up the Math of Risk strategy now! I really like how Melissa switched up her approach to make the argument for risk-based regression testing more concrete by attaching numbers to it - some things can be harder for folks to visualize, and finding a way to quantify it can be super useful for getting past that.

* [The employee attrition spike is here â€“ how to hang on to your best people](https://www-atlassian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.atlassian.com/blog/leadership/attrition-spike/amp) from Sarah Larson at Atlassian: I've been seeing various articles and posts on social media about the "great migration" we're seeing and expect to see in tech. As a manager, I'm obviously interested in that wave of turnover and doing what I can to make sure my team is getting what they need out of working with me. I did a "stay interview" with everyone on my team, using the questions suggested in the article. I sent the questions via Google Form so people would have time to think about their reponses and give thoughtful answers, and sent it out in an email with all the context around what a "stay interview" is and why it was important to me. Everyone was really honest in their answers and in the follow-up 1:1s, and I came away with actionable information that I can use to be a better manager for people.
