* [Introducing change: Risk based regression](https://fishoutthebox.medium.com/introducing-change-risk-based-regression-58969eb7bce9) from Melissa Fisher: Melissa uses the concept of risk-based regression testing as a great vehicle for talking about change management! It's one thing to be confident that the change you're suggesting is necessary, but it's another effort entirely to actually get that buy-in ðŸ˜„ I need to look up the Math of Risk strategy now! I really like how Melissa switched up her approach to make the argument for risk-based regression testing more concrete by attaching numbers to it - some things can be harder for folks to visualize, and finding a way to quantify it can be super useful for getting past that.

* [The employee attrition spike is here â€“ how to hang on to your best people](https://www-atlassian-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.atlassian.com/blog/leadership/attrition-spike/amp) from Sarah Larson at Atlassian: We're hearing a lot about the "great migration" we're seeing and expect to see in the tech industry this year. As a manager, I'm obviously interested in that wave of turnover and doing what I can to make sure my team is getting what they need out of working with me. I did a "stay interview" with everyone on my team a couple of weeks ago, using the questions suggested in the article. I sent the questions via Google Form so people would have time to think about their reponses and give thoughtful answers, and sent it out in an email with all the context around what a "stay interview" is and why it was important to me. Everyone was super honest in their answers and in the follow-up 1:1s, and I came away with actionable information that I can use to be a better manager for people.

* [How I Made $80,000 On Side Projects In 2020](https://www.compiled.blog/blog/how-i-made-80000-in-2020) from Emma Bostian: I love seeing more folks talk about money in tech! As I continue thinking about the path of my career, financial responsibilities, and the possibility of eventual retirement - I'm thinking about opportunities for passive income (as an elder millenial, I long ago bid farewell to the idea of Social Security). Emma shares some excellent experience-based insights and advice around her side projects; how they made money, and some pros and cons of trying such a venture yourself. I'm really mulling over the idea of writing a book - anybody want to collab on a quality and/or management idea? ðŸ˜„ 

* [Yak Spotting](https://avivbenyosef.com/yak-spotting/) from Aviv Ben-Yosef: I like this reminder to be reflective on your actions and think about your intentions. I think his question can also be a helpful prompt _before_ you get sucked into shaving yaks or chasing rabbits - a mindful pause when you're organizing your ever-growing TODO list or planning out your work for the day.

* [Shifting Accessibility Testing to the Left](https://applitools.com/blog/shifting-accessibility-testing-to-the-left/) from Marie Drake: I've dabbled in accessibility throughout my various roles in tech, and I love Marie's callout here. Accessibility is more than testing against the WCAG standards - it's the conversations you're having throughout the company about inclusivity. It's how product prioritizes accessibility work, especially if there's tech debt built up around it. It's how design and UX think about user needs when they're creating wireframes and mock-ups. It's how engineers incorporate accessibility patterns into their work as a default practice. It's also about education - making sure that everyone has the resources they need to learn and implement accessibility into their work.
