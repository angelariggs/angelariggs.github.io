Welcome to the fifth and final post in my [New Managers]({% post_url 2020-01-16-first-time-manager %}) series! I've talked about ways to create a supportive culture, self-care, and what your responsibilities might look like as a new manager. For this last post, I want to talk about how to manage people effectively so that you and they can succeed!

The tl;dr of effective management is to develop your core skills (also know as "soft skills"). It's a somewhat common fallacy that core skills are innate - e.g. you either have them or you don't - but as a former early childhood teacher please believe me when I say that core skills are 100% learnable throughout your entire career. (If you're interested in a broader exploration of this topic, I'll be speaking about it at [Test Leadership Congress](https://testleadership2020.sched.com/speaker/riggs.ang) this summer!)

But let's dive a little deeper into this! When I asked for feedback and advice about [being a new manager on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AngelaRiggs_/status/1216078559346741249), here are some of the responses that fell into this category of effective management:

- Know your folks as individuals and treat them as such. There is so much value in what an individual brings when one can see it and pave the way for that person and what they have to offer.
- Don't think of yourself as "the boss", but someone who is responsible for supporting, developing, and enabling my people to do their best work and love what they do.
- Help them establish both career and personal development goals.
- Be overly clear on expectations. People are more happy/productive if they don't have to guess about their day-to-day work. Be transparent on the why behind priorities.
- Learn everyone's preferred communication style and how they'd like to be recognized for doing well.
- Avoid fixing people; channel your energy into getting them into a position where their weaknesses don’t matter and their strengths can shine. 
- Small early feedback is gentler and more successful than waiting till the problem is a large problem.
- Ask people to solve problems and deliver a capabilities rather than to do tasks. You want to engage their ownership and creativity.
- Don’t try to scrap everything broken in your first month. Pick the key hill to die on.
- Effective delegation can help to up skill team members.
- See reports as appreciating assets, not an operational cost. The more you invest in wellbeing and development the more you gain in return. Also, they know their job better than you do. Set expectations and shared objectives, then support with coaching and opportunity to grow.
- Learned to manage up & down. Understanding personality types & how they respond to stress. And protecting teams at all costs.
- Don’t assume we have the same weaknesses/strengths. Don’t assume we make decisions the same way.
- Set them up for success and make expectations (yours or from above you) transparent so they can hit them and know it.

Looking at that feedback, you can see that effective management depends on communication, curiosity, empathy, leadership, compassion, change management, adaptability - core skills, every one of 'em.

**Know your folks as individuals and treat them as such.** People bring their whole selves to work. Ignoring that fact means that you won't be able to effectively coach or connect with your people. How do they like to communicate? How do they celebrate wins? What stresses them out, and what does that look like? What are their goals? How do they like to learn? What are their past experiences?

Your people are different from each other, and they're different from *you*. Find out when they need coaching and when they need mentoring. Understand how they receive and share communication. 

**Small early feedback is gentler and more successful than waiting until something is a large problem.** YES. This is really hard for lots of people - we don't like giving negative feedback and we don't know how to do it. This is where the ["feedback sandwich"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisacohn/2017/06/20/please-stop-using-the-feedback-sandwich), or where managers just avoid giving the feedback at all until they absolutely have to, at which point the employee is surprised by something that they've never heard about. But it's literally *your job* to give feedback, so you need to understand how to do it effectively. 

The first thing to know is that "effective" and "kind" are not mutually exclusive - you can give effective feedback without being a jerk. The second thing to know is that it's hard to give negative or corrective feedback. It just is! Accept that and do it anyway. I really like Lara Hogan's [equation for feedback](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/): *observation of a behavior + impact of behavior + a question or request.* 

The third thing to know is that feedback, whether it's positive or negative, should be given early. If it's praise, share it freely! Build up your people's confidence, show them that their work is noticed and valued. If it's corrective, bring it up in your next 1:1. I've seen managers wait until a quarterly review, or until it's something that becomes more of a blockers - in both cases, you're not giving them a chance to address the feedback in a timely and useful manner, which is unfair to them and detrimental to their progression. Kind, honest, timely are the watchwords for effective feedback. Take it to heart. 

**Engage people's ownership and creativity.** I think this is such an important reminder. As a manager, it's easy to to just give someone a challenge and a solution - but that doesn't do anything for your people's growth or trust. Give them a challenge, but let them figure out a solution. You can even start with a high-level desired outcome to inform their choices or decisions without hampering their ability to solve it themselves.
