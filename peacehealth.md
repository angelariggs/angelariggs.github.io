	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>About PeaceHealth</h2>
	<p>PeaceHealth's public-facing website was originally built with SharePoint. They wanted to replace their CMS in order to increase functionality and simplify the administrative user interface. To help PeaceHealth accomplish their goals, Metal Toad rebuilt PeaceHealth.org on Drupal 7, and migrated their SharePoint Mongo database to MySQL for import into Drupal.</p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>My intial contributions to PeaceHealth were QA'ing JIRA tickets for development work, and styling the admin user interface with CSS/Sass. As the project grew, there were more opportunities for me to contribute, and I began doing Drupal development work for PeaceHealth.</p>

	<p>Some of my main contributions for this project included building a module for the top navigation; creating detailed documentation for the PeaceHealth admin team's training; testing and configuring the Workbench module according to the team's needs; styling the footer content and Medical Center banner flyouts, as well as the administration interface theme.</p>
