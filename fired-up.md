<p>I am sad, angry, and scared by Trump's America. I don't want to just talk about it on social media - I want to get active and work for change. I've started a Google spreadsheet with information on actions, resources, and support to help myself stay informed and find ways to make a difference.</p>

<p>The Google spreadsheet is viewable by anyone with the link. Please share it! If you have something you'd like to add, please <a href="https://github.com/angelariggs/angelariggs.github.io/issues">open an issue </a> on the Github repo for this website. I've added labels (support, resource, or action) for the issues, so it's easier for me to keep everything organized.</p>

<p>Take a look at the spreadsheet <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o7jwlFrhIi0XspUPJ7WQwI7vYFC6e3x67GfmhSgD_7o">here.</a></p>

<p>Resist!</p>
