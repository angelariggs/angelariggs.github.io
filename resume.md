	<h1 class="res-sec-title">Development Experience</h1>
	<h2 class="res-h2">QA Engineer</h2>
	<h3 class="res-h3">Metal Toad • March 2016 - Present</h3>
	<p>As the QA engineer for my team, I own quality assurance for more than 20 projects, ranging from general QA of feature work, to visual regression and accessibility testing, to setting up and implementing continuous integration. In addition to testing developers' work against the stated acceptance criteria, I am also an advocate for client and user experiences. Examples include recommending a drag and drop ordering functionality over a weighted ordering system, or creating and implementing a test plan to recommend iterative feature improvements. I constantly strive to improve our process, with an eye to always improving our quality. I created a cleaner workflow in Jira, so tickets could be attended to and deployed more quickly, and helped Metal Toad move toward continuous integration by setting up projects on Atlassian's Bamboo product.</p>

	<h2 class="res-h2">Developer Intern</h2>
	<h3 class="res-h3">Metal Toad • September 2015 - March 2016</h3>
	<p>During my internship at Metal Toad, I went well above and beyond the role of a typical intern. Some of my accomplishments included development work for Drupal 7, Drupal 8, and Swift projects; creation of a Drupal update script for internal use with Node and AWS (collaborative effort); several pieces of detailed admin documentation for clients’ use and training; immersion in Agile methodologies for project planning and implementation; and strengthening the Metal Toad QA process by comparing and analyzing project workflows. (Yes, I got the job!)</p>

	<h2 class="res-h2">Front-End Developer</h2>
	<h3 class="res-h3">Hack Oregon - Crop Compass • September 2015 - October 2015</h3>
	<p>For this project on agriculture in Oregon, I created interactive charts and graphs using AngularJS, pulling data from custom APIs created by the back-end developers on the Crop Compass team.</p>
