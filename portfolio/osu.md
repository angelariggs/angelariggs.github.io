  <h2 class='project-sec-header'>About OSU - NEP</h2>
  <p>The internal content team for OSU's Nutrition Education Program website desired a simpler content management system, with more intuitive site architecture and admin interface. To help the OSU-NEP team accomplish their goals, we rebuilt the NEP site on Drupal 7, designed and implemented a new site layout, and created flexible content types for the team's resources.</p>


  <h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>The OSU Nutrition Education Program project was a fairly basic Drupal 7 site build. I paired with one of our <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAABj50rUBWgFhjaVYBLpy4dlQY6U5laQ3t5A'>junior developers</a> to build out the architecture. The biggest piece of this website was the resource library, where the internal NEP team houses all of their resource content for staff and partners. We also created several content types to allow for more flexible and intuitive content creation</p>

  <h2 class='project-sec-header'>Reflection</h2>
  <p>After my experience diving into the more complicated <a href="http://angelariggs.github.io/portfolio/peacehealth/">PeaceHealth project</a>, the OSU-NEP project offered a great opportunity to strengthen my Drupal experience and understanding. The project allowed me to focus on the basics of Drupal site-building - selecting and configuring modules, writing update scripts, creating views, pages, and blocks, and working with features.</p>
