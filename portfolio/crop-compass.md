	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>About Crop Compass</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.hackoregon.org">Hack Oregon</a> is a community-powered non-profit group, building civic data projects on different themes to promote engagement, awareness, and quality of life.</p>

	<p>The Crop Compass website was created as part of the Summer / Fall 2015 Hack Oregon project season. Crop Compass' theme was agriculture, and we wanted to find a way to showcase the fantastic and varied information about farming and land use in Oregon. </p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>Crop Compass was a very hefty project - we were inundated with data! The biggest hurdle was deciding what data the team wanted to use, and how to present it to the public. I joined the project as a front-end developer about 4 weeks before its completion, along with two other junior developers. We toyed with D3 and Leaflet for displaying data, but settled on a combination of Angular and Sass for displaying our charts and graphs.</p>
