	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>About PeaceHealth</h2>
	<p>PeaceHealth's public-facing website was originally built with SharePoint. They wanted to replace their CMS in order to increase functionality and simplify the administrative user interface. To help PeaceHealth accomplish their goals, Metal Toad rebuilt PeaceHealth.org on Drupal 7, and migrated their SharePoint Mongo database to MySQL for import into Drupal.</p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>My intial contributions to PeaceHealth were QA'ing JIRA tickets for development work, and styling the admin user interface with CSS/Sass. As the project grew, there were more opportunities for me to contribute, and I began doing Drupal development work for PeaceHealth.</p>

	<p>Some of my main contributions for this project included building a module for the top navigation; creating detailed admin documentation for the PeaceHealth admin team's training; testing and configuring the Workbench module according to the PeaceHealth team's needs; styling the footer content and Medical Center banner flyouts, as well as the administration interface theme.</p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Reflection</h2>
	<p>PeaceHealth was a challenging project in many ways, but ultimately I'm proud that I got to be a part of it. I took on a fairly involved role for the project, and had the privilege and responsibility of a regular developer - estimating stories, committing to sprints, and helping the team complete our bi-weekly goals.</p>

	<p>It may seem like a lot for an intern to take on, but it was motivation to jump into the thick of it- to learn, and contribute, and get my hands down in the site. Coming from a JavaScript background, it was a great way to start getting familiar with the ins and outs of site-building with Drupal.</p>
