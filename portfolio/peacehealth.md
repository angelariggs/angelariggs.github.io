	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>About PeaceHealth</h2>
	<p>PeaceHealth's public-facing website was originally built with SharePoint. They wanted to replace their CMS in order to increase functionality and simplify the administrative user interface. To help PeaceHealth accomplish their goals, Metal Toad rebuilt PeaceHealth.org on Drupal 7, and migrated their SharePoint Mongo database to MySQL for import into Drupal.</p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>My intial contributions to PeaceHealth were QA'ing JIRA tickets for development work, and styling the admin user interface with CSS/Sass. As the project grew, there were more opportunities for me to contribute, and I began doing Drupal development work for PeaceHealth.</p>

	<p>Some of my main contributions for this project included building a module for the top navigation; creating detailed admin documentation for the PeaceHealth admin team's training; testing and configuring the Workbench module according to the PeaceHealth team's needs; styling the footer content and Medical Center banner flyouts, as well as the administration interface theme.</p>

	<h2 class='project-sec-header'>Reflection</h2>
	<p>When I was first assigned to PeaceHealth as an intern about halfway through the project's timeline, there was an expectation for mentorship and pair programming opportunities. However, the project became more complicated than originally thought, and I ended up doing quite a bit of programming in a developer role rather than an intern role. While this may not seem like an ideal process, the situation allowed me to make an opportunity for myself, and become a purposeful and meaningful contributor to the project.</p>
